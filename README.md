# Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models

This repository accompanies the final ML project submission by Ronit Tushir and Ambica Bhatia (NYU Tandon, Spring 2025). It explores and replicates the adversarial attack framework from the paper:

> **Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models**  
> Zou et al., 2023 ‚Äî [arXiv:2307.15043](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043)

## üî¨ Project Objective

We reproduce and critically evaluate the **Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG)** attack for aligned LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) and explore a high-efficiency extension known as **nanoGCG**. The core hypothesis tested is:

> *A single, universal adversarial suffix‚Äîoptimized on a base LLM‚Äîcan transfer to and jailbreak aligned instruction-following models.*

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main_Notebook.ipynb # Full theory walkthrough + GCG Demo + nanoGCG Demo + OpenAI Client


‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GCG_Demo.ipynb # Focused implementation of GCG based on official llm-attacks repo


‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nanoGCG_Demo.ipynb # AdvBench-based evaluation using Gray Swan's nanoGCG


‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpenAI_Client_Prompter.ipynb # Minimal prompt tester for OpenAI's GPT-3.5/GPT-4

## üìä Notable Results

- GCG achieves ~65‚Äì75% success on fixed harmful prompts (e.g., death threats) within 20 minutes.
- nanoGCG matches performance on randomized AdvBench prompts in under 15 minutes ‚Äî enabling efficient, scalable adversarial testing.
- Transferability to GPT-3.5 observed; GPT-4 and Claude show near-zero success due to stronger alignment.
